###  socketio-chat


Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, 
bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server. 
It is built on top of the WebSocket protocol and provides additional guarantees 
like fallback to HTTP long-polling or automatic reconnection.

The main idea behind Socket.IO is that you can send and receive any events you want, 
with any data you want. Any objects that can be encoded as JSON will do, 
and binary data is supported too.
